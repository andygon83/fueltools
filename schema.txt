## For example, to generate a price list for a customer with ID 1, you could use a query like this:

SELECT a.iata AS airport_name, fp.fuel_type, fp.price, fp.fee, fp.note, fp.other_variable
FROM airports a
JOIN fuel_prices fp ON a.id = fp.airport_id
JOIN customer_airports ca ON a.id = ca.airport_id
WHERE ca.customer_id = 1
ORDER BY a.name, fp.fuel_type


### To retrieve historical pricing information for an airport, you could use a query that selects all rows from the fuel_prices table where the airport_id matches the ID of the airport you're interested in, ordered by date in descending order. For example, to retrieve the five most recent fuel prices for airport ID 1234, you could use a query like this:

SELECT *
FROM fuel_prices
WHERE airport_id = 1234
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 5
